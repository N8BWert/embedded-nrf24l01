# rust-nrf24l01

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/nrf24l01.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/nrf24l01)

* [Documentation](https://docs.rs/nrf24l01/0.1.0/)

A pure Rust user space driver for NRF24L01(+) transceivers on Linux.

The aim of this driver is to provide a rustic, easy to use, no non-sense
API to drive an NRF24L01(+) transceiver.

This is not a port from another language, this driver has been written from scratch
based on the device specs.

For the moment, the driver only exposes an API for the most reliable communication
scheme offered by NRF24L01 chips, that is _Enhanced Shockburst_ â„¢:
automatic (hardware) packet acknowlegement with optional payload, dynamic payload length and
long CRC (2 bytes).

The code has been tested on a Raspberry Pi with success. It should work on any platform supported
by [rust-spidev][1] and [rust-sysfs-gpio][2].

## Examples

### Simple emitter

```rust
extern crate nrf24l01;

use std::time::Duration;
use std::thread::sleep;

use nrf24l01::{TXConfig, NRF24L01, PALevel, OperatingMode};

fn main() {
    let config = TXConfig {
        channel: 108,
        pa_level: PALevel::Low,
        pipe0_address: *b"abcde",
        max_retries: 3,
        retry_delay: 2,
        ..Default::default()
    };

    let mut device = NRF24L01::new(25, 0).unwrap();
    let message = b"sendtest";
    device.configure(&OperatingMode::TX(config)).unwrap();
    device.flush_output().unwrap();

    loop {
        device.push(0, message).unwrap();
        match device.send() {
            Ok(retries) => println!("Message sent, {} retries needed", retries),
            Err(err) => {
                println!("Destination unreachable: {:?}", err);
                device.flush_output().unwrap()
            }
        };
        sleep(Duration::from_millis(5000));
    }
}
```

### Simple receiver listening to the simple emitter

```rust
extern crate nrf24l01;

use std::time::Duration;
use std::thread::sleep;

use nrf24l01::{RXConfig, NRF24L01, PALevel, OperatingMode};

fn main() {
    let config = RXConfig {
        channel: 108,
        pa_level: PALevel::Low,
        pipe0_address: *b"abcde",
        ..Default::default()
    };

    let mut device = NRF24L01::new(25, 0).unwrap();
    device.configure(&OperatingMode::RX(config)).unwrap();

    device.listen().unwrap();

    loop {
        sleep(Duration::from_millis(500));
        if device.data_available().unwrap() {
            device
                .read_all(|packet| {
                    println!("Received {:?} bytes", packet.len());
                    println!("Payload {:?}", packet);
                })
                .unwrap();
        }
    }
}
```

* [simple_receiver_ack.rs](https://github.com/rtxm/rust-nrf24l01/blob/master/examples/simple_receiver_ack.rs): a simple receiver that attaches payloads to ACKs;
* [multiceiver_ack.rs](https://github.com/rtxm/rust-nrf24l01/blob/master/examples/multiceiver_ack.rs): an example of a multiceiver that attaches distinct payloads for specific peers.

## Cross-compilation

The [rust-cross guide][3] has detailled and comprehensive instructions for cross compiling.

[3]: https://github.com/japaric/rust-cross

Once you are set up for say, ARM, you can cross-compile the examples for a Raspberry Pi as easily as:

```bash
cargo build -v --examples --target=arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
```

Then, you can move any of the executables to your test machine:

```bash
scp target/arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf/debug/examples/multiceiver_ack ...
```

## Future

In the future, I'd like to provide :

* asynchronous operation, with mio;
* a stream based API for fast, "real time", data transmission
at the cost of possible packet loss.

I'm still quite new to Rust, so the code may be suboptimal. Feel free to submit pull requests to improve it!
